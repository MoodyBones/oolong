## [0.1.0] - 2025-10-10

### Added - Initial Concept

- Project conception: Career transformation story platform
- Inspired by Australia's Leaky Pipeline Report
- Core vision: Reframing tool, not just story platform
- Transformation narrative arc defined: barrier → reflection → action → growth
- Visual-first, AI-assisted development approach chosen

### Philosophy

- Stories must demonstrate agency, not just trauma
- Both "stayed in tech" and "left tech" are valid outcomes
- Action is required element of every story
- Guided freeform storytelling (not rigid forms)
