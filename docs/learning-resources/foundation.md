# Goodsomeday: Foundation Document

**A Visual-First Learning Journey in 6 Milestones**

---

## Project Overview

**What:** A platform for sharing career journey stories, inspired by Australia's Leaky Pipeline Report  
**Why:** To learn visual-first, AI-assisted full-stack development while building something meaningful  
**How:** Using modern tools (n8n, Claude Code, Figma MCP) that match a visual learner's style

**Total estimated effort:** 24-34 hours  
**Typical timeframe:** 2-3 weeks  
**Approach:** Iterative, flexible, sustainable

---

## Quick Start: Your First Session

**New to the project? Start here:**

1. Read "Core Philosophy" below (understand the approach)
2. Review current milestone in "The 6 Milestones" section
3. **Before each work session:** Open fresh Claude chat, say **"Run my daily activation"**
4. Follow the interactive prompts → land on ONE tiny action → set 20-min timer → start
5. After 20 min: Continue if engaged, or celebrate and stop

**That's it.** The daily activation system handles starting friction. The milestones guide what to build. The chat templates help when stuck.

## Core Philosophy

### What This Project IS

- Visual-first learning journey
- AI-assisted development (Claude Code for boilerplate)
- Learning just enough backend to use modern tools effectively
- Stepping stone to Figma MCP and design systems
- Building on your strengths (frontend, visual learning, accessibility)
- Open-source, building in public
- Values-driven: equality, fair work, accessibility

### What This Project ISN'T

- Traditional full-stack mastery
- Hand-coding backend APIs from scratch
- Becoming a database optimisation expert
- Sprint-based with rigid deadlines
- Losing your frontend developer identity

### Your Unique Approach

**Traditional Path:**

- Learn Express.js → Write API routes → Master SQL → Optimise databases

**Your Path:**

- Use n8n visual workflows (no Express.js)
- PostgreSQL via n8n nodes (minimal raw SQL)
- Claude Code generates boilerplate
- Stay frontend-focused, use tools for the rest

**Why It Works:**

- You're a visual learner
- Databases don't excite you (and that's fine)
- Your passion: beautiful, accessible frontends
- Your real goal: Figma MCP integration and design systems
- Fair work means tools adapt to humans, not vice versa

---

## Tech Stack Rationale

### Frontend (Your Comfort Zone)

- **Next.js 14:** App router, server components, modern patterns
- **TypeScript:** Type safety, better learning through explicit interfaces
- **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first, fast iteration, matches component thinking

### Backend (Visual & AI-Assisted)

- **n8n:** Visual workflow automation - see the logic flow, no Express.js
- **PostgreSQL:** Industry-standard database, accessed via n8n nodes
- **Claude Code:** Generates components and boilerplate you don't want to write

### Infrastructure

- **VPS (DigitalOcean):** Real server experience, full control
- **Nginx:** Reverse proxy, SSL termination
- **PM2:** Process management, auto-restart

### Future Goal

- **Figma MCP:** Design-to-code automation (this is where you're really headed)
- **Code Connect:** Better design-developer collaboration

## Chat Templates System

### Daily Activation Trigger (START HERE EACH DAY)

**00-daily-activation-trigger.md** - Interactive morning ritual system

This is your primary entry point each day. When starting work:

- Say "Run my daily activation" or "DAP" to Claude in a fresh chat
- Claude asks 3 quick questions about your state (emoji, what's true, time available)
- Based on your responses, suggests one of 4 versions
- Guides you interactively to land on ONE tiny action
- Launches you into 20 minutes of focused work

**The 4 versions available:**

- **13a-version1-essential-three.md** (2-3 min) - Fast structure when scattered
- **13b-version2-flexible-six.md** (3-5 min) - Choose 3 questions that resonate
- **13c-version3-one-question.md** (30-60 sec) - Single unlock when stuck
- **13d-full-version.md** (5-10 min) - Deep reflection when you have time

**What you're learning:**

- Motivational interviewing techniques
- Cognitive science for task initiation
- Arousal regulation strategies
- Self-compassion in productivity
- Activist mindset principles
- Integrating wellbeing into workflow

**Use this system daily** to connect values to action and overcome starting friction.

### Other Templates & When to Use Each Template

   **Progress:** 2/6 milestones (33%)
   ```

3. **Review with templates:**
   - Open fresh chat with template 10 (challenging-assumptions.md)
   - Reflect on what worked, what didn't
   - Open fresh chat with template 11 (wellbeing-checkin.md)
   - Check energy levels, sustainable pace
   - Open fresh chat with template 12 (confident-humility.md)
   - Reflect on growth, celebrate learning

4. **LinkedIn Newsletter:**
   - Write update about milestone completion
   - Share key learnings
   - Be honest about challenges
   - Include visual if possible (screenshot, diagram)

5. **Rest before next milestone:**
   - Minimum 1 day break
   - Physical movement
   - Let learning consolidate

---

## Session Guidelines (Wellbeing Boundaries)

### Before Starting a Session

- **Run your daily activation** (see template 00-daily-activation-trigger.md)
  - Opens a fresh Claude chat
  - Say "Run my daily activation" or "DAP"
  - Follow the interactive prompts
  - Land on ONE tiny action for the next 20 minutes
- Or if you already know what you're working on:
  - Choose which milestone/ticket
  - Set a 2-3 hour timer
  - Clear workspace, hydrate, have snacks ready
  - Check energy level (if low, use daily activation first)

### During the Session

- Work focused on current ticket
- Take 5-10 min break every hour (walk, stretch, water)
- If stuck for 30+ min, use chat templates for help
- Track time in Linear as you go
- Commit frequently (small commits = easier to review)

### After the Session

- Update Linear with learning notes
- Commit and push all work
- Record actual time spent
- **Stop even if "almost done"** (honour the 2-3 hour boundary)
- Small task to finish? Max 30 min over, then stop
- Rest before next session

### Between Sessions

- Minimum 1-2 hour break
- Ideally next session on different day
- Physical movement (walk, exercise)
- Hydration and proper meals
- Let learning consolidate through rest

### When to Stop Immediately

- Frustration rising (>30 min stuck = use chat template)
- Energy crashing (rest, don't push through)
- Making silly mistakes (sign of cognitive fatigue)
- Losing track of time (timer helps prevent this)
- Physical discomfort (headache, eye strain, tension)

**Remember:** Sustainable pace beats rushed completion. You're building a learning system, not just a product.

## Key Mantras

**Learning Focus:**

- "Tools adapt to humans, not the other way around"
- "Learning just enough backend to never do it manually again"
- "Visual workflows, AI assistance, focus on strengths"
- "The real goal is design systems, not database optimisation"

**Wellbeing:**

- "Sustainable pace beats rushed completion"
- "2-3 hours max, then stop"
- "Rest is productive"
- "Stuck for 30 min? Use a chat template"

**Building in Public:**

- "Document the journey, not just the destination"
- "Failures are data, share them"
- "Authentic over polished"
- "Help others learn by showing your process"

**Professional Practice:**

- "Feature branch → PR → review → merge"
- "Commit messages explain why, not just what"
- "Self-review catches bugs before others see them"
- "Documentation now = clarity later"

---

## Success Indicators

You're on track if:

- Completing milestones, not rushing through them
- Learning notes filled in for each ticket
- Using chat templates when stuck
- Taking breaks between sessions
- Celebrating completions (even small ones)
- Sharing progress authentically
- Feeling energised, not drained
- Understanding concepts, not just copying code

You need to adjust if:

- Skipping milestones or tickets
- Working 4+ hour sessions regularly
- Feeling burnt out or overwhelmed
- Avoiding asking for help
- Comparing unfavourably to others
- Losing sight of why you started
- Perfectionism blocking progress

**When in doubt:** Open a chat with template 11 (wellbeing-checkin.md)
