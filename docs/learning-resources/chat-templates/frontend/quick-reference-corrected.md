## 📱 Actual Design (From Your Figma Make Chat)

### Layout Structure

**Desktop:**

- Black header (80px height)
- Golden yellow hero (full-width)
- Full-width image divider (200px)
- Full-width "Featured stories" heading (48px)
- Full-width search bar (56px height)
- Two-column layout AFTER search:
  - Left: Sidebar filters (240px fixed, sticky)
  - Right: Story cards (max 840px, **VERTICAL STACK** not grid!)

**2. Sidebar Filters**

- Yellow background headers (#F9D762) when section visible
- Three sections: Focus area, Story themes, Industry

## 🚫 Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **DON'T:**

- Make story cards a grid (they're vertical stack!)
- Add shadows to cards (design has none)
- Make sidebar filters visible on mobile (should be stacked accordions)
- Use inline styles from Figma Make (refactor to Tailwind)
- Hardcode the yellow color (use theme tokens)
- Make accordions open by default on mobile (closed by default)

✅ **DO:**

- Stack story cards vertically with 24px gap
- Use white background cards with no shadows
- Hide sidebar on mobile, show stacked filters
- Convert Figma Make code to Tailwind utilities
- Use `bg-secondary` for golden yellow
- Keep mobile accordions closed by default

---

## 🧪 Mock Data Structure

```typescript
interface Story {
  id: number;
  pipelineStage: 'High School' | 'University' | 'Mid Career';
  storyText: string;
  createdAt: string;
  approved: boolean;
}

// Use 3-4 stories with realistic content
// from your Figma design screenshots
```

## 🎯 3-Hour Session Plan

### Hour 1: Foundation

- Create Next.js project
- Install shadcn/ui
- Configure colors in Tailwind
- Set up theme toggle
- **Output:** Dev server running, theme toggle works

### Hour 2: Components

- Create mock data
- Build StoryCard (white bg, no shadows, vertical)
- Build Badge with pipeline stage colors
- Build StoryFeed (vertical stack!)
- **Output:** Cards displaying from mock data

### Hour 3: Layout

- Build Hero (yellow, outline button)
- Build Header (black, nav right)
- Build Footer (black, theme toggle)
- Implement responsive (sidebar → stacked)
- **Output:** Complete homepage

---

## 🔧 Technical Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Components:** shadcn/ui (customize as needed)
- **Language:** TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Data:** Mock data (no API yet)

---

## ✅ Definition of Done

You're successful today if:

1. ✅ App runs on localhost:3000
2. ✅ Theme toggle works (light/dark)
3. ✅ Story cards display in **vertical stack** from mock data
4. ✅ Sidebar visible on desktop, stacked on mobile
5. ✅ Visual match to your Figma design
6. ✅ Golden yellow (#F9D762) used throughout

## 📝 Key Design Decisions You'll Make

As you build, decide:

- Badge styling approach (variants vs inline)
- Text truncation (how many lines?)
- Filter state management
- Mobile navigation pattern
- shadcn customization vs new components
- Responsive breakpoints

**Don't wait for perfect answers - try something, see how it feels, iterate.**
