# Oolong

A platform for sharing career journey stories - built while learning **visual-first, AI-assisted full-stack development**.

> **📚 This is a learning project.** I'm a visual learner and frontend developer exploring modern tools (n8n, Claude Code, Figma MCP) that let me build complete products without losing my soul to traditional backend development.

## 🎯 What is Oolong?

Oolong is a platform for sharing transformative career journey stories - moments when people faced barriers in tech, reflected on their experiences, and took action that led to meaningful change.

**Inspired by:** Australia's recent [Leaky Pipeline Report](https://www.vic.gov.au/leaky-tech-pipeline-report) showing where we lose women in tech careers.

### The Story Format: From Barrier to Action

Stories on Oolong follow a narrative arc designed to move from victimhood to empowerment:

1. **What happened** - The negative experience or barrier (burnout, discrimination, imposter syndrome, lack of support)
2. **Reflection** - How it made them think, what they realized about themselves or the system
3. **Action** - What they did about it (changed environments, set boundaries, found community, left tech, advocated for change)
4. **Transformation** - How they've grown and what changed as a result

**Stories are categorized by when they left (or almost left) the pipeline:**

- **Student** - Barriers during education (high school, university)
- **Early Career** - First 0-5 years in the industry
- **Mid-Career** - 5+ years, experienced professionals

**The goal:** Help others see that hope comes from action and change. Whether someone stayed in tech with new boundaries, found fulfillment elsewhere, or is still figuring it out - every story shows a path forward.

The platform focuses on authentic, structured storytelling with an emphasis on accessibility and inclusive design.

## 📖 Learning Journey

**This project exists to answer a question:** Can a visual learner who loves frontend development build complete products using modern AI and no-code tools - without becoming a traditional backend developer?

### The Approach

I'm not learning "full-stack" the traditional way. I'm learning **visual-first, AI-assisted full-stack**:

**What I'm Using:**

- 🎨 **n8n** for backend logic (drag-and-drop workflows, not Express.js)
- 🤖 **Claude Code** for component generation (review, don't write from scratch)
- 📐 **Figma MCP** for design-to-code (the real end goal)

**What I'm NOT Doing:**

- ❌ Hand-coding CRUD APIs
- ❌ Writing raw SQL queries
- ❌ Becoming a database optimization expert
- ❌ Spending months on traditional backend learning

**What I AM Doing:**

- ✅ Using visual tools that match how I think
- ✅ Letting AI handle boilerplate I don't want to write
- ✅ Focusing on beautiful, accessible frontends
- ✅ Building toward design system automation
- ✅ Shipping a product that helps people

### Why This Matters

**I care about:**

- Beautiful, accessible interfaces
- Equality and fair work in tech
- Design systems and collaboration
- Making technology approachable for everyone

**I don't care about:**

- Writing server boilerplate manually
- SQL optimization minutiae
- Pretending to love what I don't

The future isn't "everyone becomes a traditional full-stack developer." It's "use modern tools to build on your unique strengths."

### Skills I'm Developing

**Technical:**

- Visual workflow design (n8n)
- AI-assisted development (Claude Code)
- Backend concepts (without drowning in syntax)
- Design-to-code integration (Figma MCP)
- Infrastructure basics (just enough to be dangerous)

**Professional:**

- Building in public
- Systematic learning documentation
- Git workflow best practices
- Strategic tool selection
- Learning efficiency over mastery

**Track My Progress:**

- [Changelog](docs/CHANGELOG.md) - What's been built
- [Learning Resources](docs/learning-resources/) - What I learned building each feature
- [Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) - How it all fits together

## ✨ Features

**Current (MVP):**

- ✅ Story submission with visual validation (n8n workflow)
- ✅ Story feed with filtering by pipeline stage

**In Progress:**

- 🔄 Visual backend workflows (replacing traditional API code)
- 🔄 AI-generated components (Claude Code + Figma specs)
- 🔄 Accessibility-first design system

**Planned (v2.0+):**

- 📋 Figma MCP integration (design → code automation)
- 📋 Design system documentation generator
- 📋 Comments on stories
- 📋 User authentication
- 📋 Story reactions/likes
- 📋 Search functionality
